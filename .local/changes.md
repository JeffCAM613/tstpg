## 2026-09-28 - Phase 1 (foundation)

Repository
- New implementation in `src/`; the previous implementation moved unchanged to `legacy/` (`legacy/bin`, `legacy/sql`, `legacy/config`) for comparison.
- `.gitattributes` (line endings per file type), `.gitignore` (run logs, local config, survey output).

Database objects (`src/sql/install/`)
- `install.sql` (SYS): checks (SYS, not CDB$ROOT, 12.2+, tool tablespace not used by OP/OPPAYMENTS/OPREPORTS), creates or updates user EPFPG, then tables, registry, grants, packages; fails if any EPFPG object is invalid.
- `uninstall.sql` (SYS): refuses while a run is active, while accounts locked by a reclaim are not restored, or while temporary purge indexes exist; then drops EPFPG.
- `tables.sql`: all tables of plan section 5 (idempotent).
- `registry_data.sql`: 3 modules, 27 tables, 23 links (today's scope and processing order), 16 settings. Settings keep operator values on upgrade.
- `grants.sql`: system privileges, direct SELECT on dictionary views, DBMS_LOCK, INHERIT PRIVILEGES ON USER SYS (warning only if refused), SELECT/DELETE/UPDATE on registry tables present.
- Packages: `epf_util` (formatting, settings, dictionary helpers), `epf_log` (events, steps, session tagging), `epf_control` (run lifecycle with an exclusive run lock, stop requests, parameter normalisation), `epf_registry` (registry validation, including FKs from any schema into purge tables).
- The run package is named `epf_control` because a package cannot share the name of table `EPF_RUN` in the same schema.

Entry scripts (`src/sql/run/`)
- `start_run.sql`: validates parameters, creates a run, prints `EPF_RUN_ID=<n>`.
- `preflight.sql`: registry validation (grows in phase 2). `NEW` runs it standalone and prints the events.

Verification (`src/tests/verify/`)
- `environment.sql`: read-only survey of the target database; writes `epf_environment.txt`.

How to test
1. `sqlplus -L "sys@<pdb_service> AS SYSDBA" @src/sql/install/install.sql <epfpg_password> <tool_tablespace>`
   (tool tablespace: e.g. USERS, as long as OP/OPPAYMENTS/OPREPORTS have no segments there). Run it a second time: it must succeed again (idempotent).
2. `sqlplus -L -S "epfpg/<password>@<pdb_service>" @src/sql/run/preflight.sql NEW`
3. `sqlplus -L "sys@<pdb_service> AS SYSDBA" @src/tests/verify/environment.sql`
4. Return: the console output of 1 (both runs) and 2, and the file `epf_environment.txt`.
5. Optional: `@src/sql/install/uninstall.sql` as SYS, then install again.

## 2026-09-28 - Plan draft 3

- Plan moved from `plan/PLAN.md` to `.local/PLAN.md`; this change log added.
- Layout: `src/` (new), `legacy/` (previous implementation, unchanged).
- Reclaim: REFERENCE_CHECK step before DROP_OLD; REVERT path when the check fails or Oracle refuses the drop (moves everything back, drops the empty clone).
- LONG conversion confirmation shows owner, column, source tablespace and target LOB tablespace per item.
- Phase 0 split: environment survey now; behavior spikes V1-V10 before phase 5.

## 2026-09-28 - Plan draft 2

- Decisions D1-D14 applied: EPFPG tool schema; indexes UNUSABLE + REBUILD; tablespace swap with all owners; bat + PowerShell 5.1; temporary purge indexes only; modes FULL / CLOB / LOGS / CLOB_N_LOGS; purge effect always measured, compaction opt-in; childless `file_dispatching` rows purged; always LOGGING; accounts locked and sessions disconnected at reclaim start after startup confirmation; clean CLI; SYS asked at startup when reclaim is selected; LONG columns converted with per-item approval.

## 2026-09-28 - Plan draft 1

- Assessment of the previous implementation (findings F/R/L/A/S/P) and target design.
